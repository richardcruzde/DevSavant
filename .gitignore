# You can keep your repository small and manageable with a .gitignore file.
# Prevent build artifacts, large binary files, and other large file types
# such as log files, media files, and executables from slowing down your workflow.
#
# If you need to keep large files in Bitbucket, consider introducing
# Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) as part of your workflow.
